# SocialScanner

## Working to improve student mental health and make schools safer, one line of code at a time

## Collaborators

- Prasham Shah (Team Lead and Coder)
- Samik Shah (Coder)

## Setup

- Execute `./install/setup.sh` to install all dependencies and set up the ML models (make sure the correct lines for your OS are uncommented in the script)
  - May need to run `chmod +x ./install/setup.sh` to make the file executable first on a Unix-like system
- Run `python app/main.py` to start the GUI

## More Info

See this [Google Slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13rB1L6zyFAN_5x2AQQ9W1SobG433vgJ0ArSlQ-GNRxU/edit?usp=sharing) or the [PDF on this repo](docs/SocialScanner_Presentation.pdf), delivered to Northern Burlington County Regional High School's administration regarding this project.
The initiative was already commended by the school, and we plan to expand much further (hopefully 6 schools by the end of the year).
